# LRU-Caching
<p> Cache management has been a foundational component in the design of highperformance computing systems, embedded platforms, and large-scale distributed
networks. As applications demand faster data access and lower response times, the choice
of a cache replacement strategy directly affects performance efficiency. Conventional
algorithms such as LRU (Least Recently Used), LFU (Least Frequently Used), and FIFO
(First-In-First-Out) have been widely implemented due to their simplicity and intuitive
handling of temporal or frequency-based access patterns.
However, modern systems often operate under cost-sensitive environments where the
cost of accessing or retrieving a data item from the source varies significantly. Examples
include fetching a large file from remote cloud storage, accessing a resource over a slow
network, or loading multimedia content with heavy computational requirements. In such
scenarios, eviction decisions must factor in retrieval cost, not just recency or frequency.
This necessity has driven research into cost-aware cache replacement mechanisms that
extend or hybridize traditional policies to make them more adaptive and efficient.</p>
